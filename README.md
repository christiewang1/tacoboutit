Financial modeling of the economics of running a taco truck business

This repository will contain a financial model (in Excel) that lays out the economics of running a taco truck over a few years. A Monte Carlo simulation has been implemented to evaluate how the variability of key underlying assumptions impact the financial results. An accompanying PowerPoint presentation to pitch the taco truck to investors is included as well.
